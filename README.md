# Data-Management-Modules-RDAP
This repo will be used during the Friendly Intro to GitHub at RDAP 2017 workshop to collect Data Management Modules. You can follow along with my presentation [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1TrFqki9hXt0Aw9YcSACDWdVif2RI237hGkTdypxf3kI/edit?usp=sharing).

Welome to the Small Group Work Session!
Let's collaboratively design a Data Management Course with modules.   

1. **Break into groups of 3-4 people**.
2. **Designate a group coordinator**. This person will fork this repo and coordinate your groups contributions. 
3. **Group coordinator forks the repo** 

**Check point!** Does each group coordinator have a forked copy of the repo?

4. **Group Coordinator makes group members into collaborators**
- Once you become a collaborator, default settings will create a deluge of emails and notifications on all the activity in that repo. 
- We recommend adjusting you settings to "Not Watching"

5. **Group will work together to create the course**
- Use Issues to assign tasks to group members.
- Create new markdown documents for the new modules (remember to name them as .md files!)
- A list of potential modules is [here](https://github.com/daniellecrobinson/Data-Management-Modules-RDAP/blob/master/Module-Topics.md), but feel free to make up your own.
- When adding a doccument or making a change, select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request" as shown below. This will give the other collaboraters a chance to review your changes.

**Check point!** Has each group member made a change (or added a file), and started a pull request, and had other members review their change?

6. **Share back to the group** - What was intuitive? What was challenging?
